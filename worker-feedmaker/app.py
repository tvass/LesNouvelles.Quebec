"""
Module Name: worker-feedmaker/app.py
Description: This script should apply cosine similarityto create a custom feed.

For the record, expected workflow:

1. Text Preprocessing:
- Tokenize text, normalize by converting to lowercase, and remove unnecessary characters.
- Lemmatize the words to get the root form (e.g., "courir" instead of "courrait").
- Remove stop words (common words like "the", "a", "of" which don't add value for topic identification).

2. Named Entity Recognition (NER):
- Extract entities such as team names, location, date, political figures, and organizations.

3. Text Classification:
- Use a text classification model (e.g., fine-tuned BERT, XLM-Roberta, or GPT models) to classify the text into
  different predefined categories (e.g., sports, politics, etc.).
- These models can be fine-tuned on your own dataset, with labeled articles for each category.

4. Semantic Search:
- Convert the user's query and news articles into embeddings using a pre-trained transformer-based model like
  BERT, Sentence-BERT, or distilBERT.
- Calculate similarity using cosine similarity, which will provide a relevance score.

5. Ranking:
- Rank articles based on their similarity to the query. More relevant articles will have higher similarity scores.
